            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER from a Gentleman in the Countrey, to a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament, about <hi>AN EXCHEQUER-BANK.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received from you a printed Paper intituled, <hi>The only way to have the Rents of</hi> England <hi>well paid, and also help Trade, and supply the Government.</hi> Upon reading the Title I was well-pleased; but my Courage was quickly cool'd, and my Joy much abated, when I found in the Body of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>nothing proposed but Ruin to us Country-Gentlemen,</hi> and to put us in a worse Condition than we are in already. When I saw the words <hi>good Credit</hi> in the first Paragraph in a distinguishing Character, I expected to have found something recommending a Credit to be raised upon our Land; but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Author of that Paper never designed it, but has dealt with the Freeholders as we do with Children, thinking to please us with Trifles, or with what is worse; and <hi>to ruin the landed Man under a Pretence of shewing him the only way to have the Rents of</hi> England <hi>well paid;</hi> for instead of pursuing the Design of the Title, and telling us how to raise a Credit upon our Estates, he tells us only a long Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry how to make <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Tallies pass in paiment, with 4 or 5 <hi>l. per Cent. per Annum</hi> running In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> You cannot imagine how great Consternation we are in in these Parts: One is for selling his Freehold Estate, and turning his whole Purchase-Money into these Tallies, which he well observes will bring him in more than his Land by 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Year in every 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Value: Others dread being called upon for the Money they owe upon their Estates, concluding, (as they well may) that the Mortgagees will not continue their Money any longer with them upon their Estates, which they cannot command when they want it, if they can have the same Interest for their Money while it lies by them in their Chests: Others again, who must take up Money upon the Security of their Estates, do now despair of being supplied, for the aforesaid Reasons. In short, we are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concerned that tho nothing is yet done for the landed Man, besides taxing him with 4 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound; yet there are a sort of Men who are for promoting Projects in Parliament to ruin them.</p>
            <p>I cannot but observe how industriously this pretended Champion would sham us off, telling us, That <hi>had we a general Register in</hi> England, <hi>whereby Titles might be perfectly secured, and the transferring thereof made easy and short; a Method might be proposed to make even Land serve all the Ʋses of Money.</hi> 05 I am glad he acknowledges that Land may be suted to such Uses; and as I remember such a Method was laid down last Sessions of Parliament in a <hi>Treatise on the late Funds. But</hi> (says he) <hi>that is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be wish'd for than expected.</hi> He would have done well to have given us Reasons for it, for I think it may be both wish'd for and expected by the Freeholders, since it can injure no Body, if it be fixed as it may be, but be a Benefit to thousands. <hi>But</hi> (says he) <hi>I see nothing at present can supply the Ʋse of Money for Rents, Debts and Taxes, but Tallies payable on demand.</hi> And why may not Bills issued out on Land-Security, payable on demand, supply the use of Money as well as Tallies? 'Tis true, he proposes 600000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money to circulate 2500000 <hi>l.</hi> Value in Bills; and if you will encourage a Land-Bank, I am credibly inform'd that three times 600000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money will not be wanting to circulate the Land-Bills; nor will there be a Scarcity of good Titles and fair Estates to be a Fund for such <hi>Land-Bank:</hi> Which <hi>Bank</hi> will not only be able to supply his Majesty, and answer all our Occasions, but 05 will serve for more than all those Uses proposed by our Tally-Merchant. And therefore as this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man proposes to you <hi>to make an Experiment for the</hi> 2500000 <hi>l.</hi> and deliver Tallies for that Value, I humbly offer it as my Opinion, That you would rather let the Experiment you shall make, be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the landed Men, whom you well know have all along born the greatest Part of the Taxes, and not by such new Ways as will inevitably ruin them and their Families.</p>
            <p>I find the Gentleman hath hit upon one Objection himself, viz. <hi>That it may give too large a Power to the Exchequer:</hi> but he solves this Objection very lamely, <hi>viz. Those</hi> (says he) <hi>that have the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof, being limited to a certain Sum, they can no more give out tallies payable on demand exceeding the Sum limited by Parliament, than of those payable in Course; for all these Tallies may be numbred, and the Account kept as exactly as now.</hi> I see no reason to doubt his Majesty's Justice and Honour, or that he having ventured his Life in the defence of our Liberties, will ever attempt to invade them; but are we certain who may come after him? Pray, Sir, consider, What would not some of our former Kings have done had they had such a Credit lodg'd in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> when they wanted not Will, but Money and Credit only to enslave us, and to render Parliaments useless? What Punishment or Penalties can you inflict on those who having the Management of such a Trust shall exceed or abuse it? Would you inflict upon them a corporal Punishment? a <hi>dispensing Power</hi> renders that insignificant. Would you amerce them for it? To whom must the Forfeiture be paid? if to the King, no Prince will ever suffer such a Penalty to be levied upon a Subject for obeying his Command, but will most certainly remit the same. Are the Monies rising by such Forfeitures to be disposed of by Parliament? such a Prince will take care that no Parliaments shall meet to take cognisance of, much less to dispose thereof: nor, if once the <hi>Exchequer</hi> have such a Credit lodged in it, will he ever want them; and therefore <hi>when you place such a Credit in the</hi> Exchequer, <hi>it is my Opinion, That you may at the same time discharge the Subjects from the further trouble of sending their Representatives to Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> It is dangerous trying Experiments on things that may unhinge the Frame of the Goverment, if not dissolve the Government it self, and then to put your selves upon finding out Expedients to prevent the Destruction of it: If my House were in danger of Falling, I would endeavour to prop it up, but no wise Man will cut asunder the principal Beams, Girders and Rafters of his Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, in hopes of securing the same by cramping it with Iron: and I doubt not but you will take heed of such State-Empericks, who provided they can get a Penny themselves, value not tho (by their so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) they hazard the Nation.</p>
